## Overview

The Solo Traveler Survey project is a web-based application designed to collect and analyze data on solo travelers' preferences and experiences. Users can submit their responses through a simple form, and the collected data is stored in a MySQL database. The application also provides statistical insights using interactive charts powered by Chart.js.

Additionally, as a thank-you for completing the survey, the application returns a personalized prediction to the user. A clustering model and a sentiment analysis model were implemented to generate insights based on the user's responses.

## Features

- User-friendly HTML form to collect survey responses
- Data storage using MySQL for persistence
- Flask backend to handle form submissions and database interactions
- Dynamic visualization of survey results with Chart.js
- Predictive insights using a clustering model and sentiment analysis
- Minimalistic UI for ease of use
